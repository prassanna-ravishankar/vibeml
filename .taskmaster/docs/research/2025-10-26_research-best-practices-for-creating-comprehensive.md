# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Research best practices for creating comprehensive MkDocs documentation for a Python project similar to VibeML. Include:
1. Recommended MkDocs plugins and themes for technical documentation
2. Documentation structure for ML/AI tool projects
3. How to integrate API reference documentation from docstrings
4. Best practices for tutorials, user guides, and reference documentation
5. How to set up automatic documentation deployment (GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs)
6. Examples of well-documented Python ML tools using MkDocs

**Response:**

**MkDocs Foundations**

- Material for MkDocs is the de facto choice for modern Python tooling docs: built-in light/dark palettes, tabbed content, and first-class search. Pair with `mkdocs-material[imaging]` for optimized diagrams and callouts that explain `src/vibeml/__main__.py` workflows or `src/vibeml/config/credentials.py` encryption steps.  
- Augment baseline navigation with `mkdocs-section-index` (clean landing pages inside `docs/`), `mkdocs-literate-nav` (YAML-driven nav mirroring CLI command groupings), and `mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin` (lightweight nav sorting). For notebooks or visualization walkthroughs (cost estimator, resource validators), keep `mkdocs-jupyter` on the radar but gate it behind caching so build times stay predictable.  
- For ML-specific content reuse, `macros` plugin lets you centralize glossary terms (GPU tiers, budget enforcement) and insert them consistently across tutorials, avoiding duplication between `docs/usage.md` and future workflow guides.

**Documentation Information Architecture**

- Mirror VibeML’s user journey: start with “Get Started” (install, configure, first workflow) referencing config wizard and credentials setup; follow with “Concepts” that explain TrainingRequest, JobHandle, and error recovery orchestration; then “How-to Guides” for tasks like running jobs, tracking budgets, and debugging cloud credentials.  
- Reserve a “Reference” section for API (Pydantic models, CLI commands, MCP server endpoints) and “Internals” for architecture diagrams of monitoring/deployment features from Task 14. Place cross-links between guides and references—e.g., the job lifecycle guide should point to `CostEstimate` model docs for field semantics.  
- Add a “Playbooks & Troubleshooting” collection that aligns with the CLI help system: include guides for transient cloud failures, dataset access errors, and budget breach scenarios defined in `src/vibeml/exceptions.py`. This keeps recovery procedures discoverable outside the terminal.

**Generating API Reference from Docstrings**

- Adopt `mkdocstrings[python]` to render documentation directly from Pydantic model docstrings and CLI command functions. Place configuration in `mkdocs.yml` with a `handlers.python` section setting `selection.memory = 0` (fresh imports per build) and `options.docstring_style = google` to match typical Python docstring style.  
- Ensure docstrings are rich: for models in `src/vibeml/models.py`, document each field with valid ranges and example JSON payloads; for CLI commands, detail return codes and side effects. Mkdocstrings will respect type hints, so lean on Pydantic type metadata to show expected structures automatically.  
- To prevent import side effects (e.g., hitting cloud APIs), configure `plugins.mkdocstrings.handlers.python.setup_commands` to patch environment variables or use lightweight stubs. Alternatively, place API-level docs under `docs/reference/` and instruct mkdocstrings to load from the installed package via `watch` paths pointing to `src/`.

**Tutorials, How-to Guides, and References**

- Tutorials should be end-to-end narratives: “Launch your first workflow on Nebius” can walk through config wizard, preference tuning, job submission, and monitoring, referencing Task 13 CLI enhancements. Use numbered steps, screenshots (provider logos), and callouts for pitfalls like region quotas.  
- How-to guides cover single objectives: “Validate configuration” should document CLI command usage, relevant config files (`~/.vibeml/config.json`), and expected log outputs. Keep them task-oriented, 5–7 steps max, with links to troubleshooting pages for failure scenarios.  
- Reference docs remain terse and systematic: present CLI commands in tabular form (name, syntax, flags, examples), align Pydantic models with JSON schema fragments, and include cross-references to error classes so users see which exceptions might surface. Maintain consistent front matter (title, summary, prerequisites) to support search.

**Integrated Examples and Code Snippets**

- For each workflow, provide `bash` snippets showing CLI invocations plus resulting JSON responses, matching actual `JobHandle` structures. Wrap Python usage examples with `python` fences and demonstrate error handling callbacks that leverage the expanded exception hierarchy.  
- Include configuration snippets (`yaml`/`json`) for credential files, budget policies, and Kubernetes manifests; annotate them with inline comments describing security implications (e.g., API key storage). Ensure examples remain minimal yet executable—provide context about environment variables or required prerequisite steps.

**Automation and Deployment**

- Centralize configuration in `mkdocs.yml`, enabling Material features (`features: navigation.tabs`, `navigation.instant`, `content.code.copy`). Use `docs/requirements.txt` to pin plugin versions.  
- For GitHub Pages, add a workflow under `.github/workflows/docs.yml` that installs dependencies (`pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`), runs `mkdocs build --strict`, and deploys with `mike` or `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`. Using `mkdocs gh-deploy --force` from CI keeps the branch clean; just store `ci-token` as a secret.  
- For Read the Docs (already have `.readthedocs.yml`), configure `mkdocs` as the build backend, list Python dependencies, and ensure `mkdocs-material` and `mkdocstrings` are included. After enabling the project in RTD, builds trigger on commits/tags.  
- Set up pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) to run `mkdocs build --strict` or `mkdocs serve --dirtyreload` locally for fast feedback, preventing broken navigation or syntax errors before committing.

**Examples of MkDocs in ML Tools**

- Hugging Face Optimum uses Material with mkdocstrings to document model optimization APIs—note how they group hardware backends and include API callouts beside narrative guides.  
- BentoML’s documentation demonstrates layered navigation: high-level concepts, tutorials, reference, and deployment playbooks; observe their use of admonitions for warnings about GPU requirements.  
- ZenML’s docs show effective plugin use (mermaid diagrams, tabs) and deep integration with Python docstrings; they maintain consistent front matter and highlight CLI + Python SDK parity.

**Pitfalls and Edge Cases**

- Avoid leaking secrets: ensure mkdocstrings imports do not execute credential loaders (`src/vibeml/config/credentials.py`). Introduce guard clauses (`if TYPE_CHECKING`) or environment flags to skip runtime behaviors during docs builds.  
- Watch build performance: heavy dependencies or network calls throttle MkDocs builds in CI. Cache dependencies via `actions/cache` keyed on `docs/requirements.txt`, and keep API doc builds incremental by running mkdocs in `--dirty` mode locally.  
- Maintain versioned documentation as the CLI evolves: use `mike` to publish `latest` and version tags, aligning with Task 14 deployment scripts. Document breaking changes in a changelog page accessible from docs navigation.  
- Guarantee accessibility: enable Material’s skip links, ensure color contrasts meet WCAG AA, and add `aria-labels` where necessary in custom templates. Provide textual alternatives for diagrams describing job lifecycle or monitoring dashboards.
