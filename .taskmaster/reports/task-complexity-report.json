			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the persistence layer work: include designing the SQLite-backed repository and schema, wiring repository lifecycle into server startup/shutdown, refactoring job launch/status/stop paths to persist state, handling metadata serialization & async safety, and adding focused unit/integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "Requires introducing a new SQLite persistence module, integrating it with existing FastMCP server lifecycle, refactoring multiple job management paths to replace in-memory dict access, solving metadata serialization and async blocking concerns, adding defensive error handling, and building both repository-level and async server tests; moderate architectural change with non-trivial testing."
