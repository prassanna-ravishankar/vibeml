			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this work into subtasks that cover rewriting the architecture docs around the SkyPilot-backed MCP design, removing the persistence package/tests and cleaning imports, refactoring server tools to source job state via sky.status/sky.jobs and the SkyPilot state file, updating JobHandle modelling/mapping for SkyPilot data, refreshing user docs that reference the old job tracker, and adding async tests that monkeypatch SkyPilot APIs.",
			"reasoning": "The current MCP server is tightly coupled to the SQLite persistence layer—see the global repository logic and ACTIVE_CLUSTERS usage in src/vibeml/server.py:23-118, 200-282—so shifting to native SkyPilot state requires reworking every lifecycle entry point plus new helpers to map SkyPilot statuses to JobStatus while handling ~/.sky/state.json fallbacks. JobHandle in src/vibeml/models.py:68-109 assumes DB-backed metadata, so it must be reshaped to consume sky.status/sky.jobs outputs. Removing persistence means deleting src/vibeml/persistence/* and rewriting associated imports/tests (tests/test_persistence.py:1-160), alongside creating new async tests that monkeypatch sky.launch/status/down behaviours to cover the new integration. Documentation updates span multiple navigation entries (mkdocs.yml:53-114) and currently empty stubs like docs/concepts/architecture.md and docs/how-to/use-mcp.md, which need substantive content on the SkyPilot contract. Overall this is a broad refactor with coordination across code, tests, and docs, but it leverages existing FastMCP structure and SkyPilot APIs, keeping complexity high yet manageable."
