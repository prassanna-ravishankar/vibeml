VibeML democratizes AI model training by providing natural language access to multi-cloud GPU resources through MCP (Model Context Protocol) and SkyPilot.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Launch training jobs using natural language through Claude or ChatGPT
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Seamlessly deploy across AWS, GCP, Azure, and Nebius Cloud
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatic GPU selection, spot instance management, and budget tracking
- **Pre-configured Workflows**: Unsloth, LoRA, and full fine-tuning templates ready to use
- **MCP Integration**: First-class support for Model Context Protocol
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, validation, and monitoring

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install VibeML
uv tool install vibeml

# Launch your first training job
vibeml launch-training \
  --model meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B \
  --dataset tatsu-lab/alpaca \
  --workflow unsloth \
  --gpu-type L40S \
  --max-cost 15.0
```

Or use with Claude Code via MCP:
```
"Train Llama-3.2-1B on the Alpaca dataset using Nebius L40S GPUs with a $15 budget"
```

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Cloud provider account (Nebius, AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- HuggingFace account (for accessing models and datasets)

## Installation

You can install _vibeml_ via [pip] from [PyPI]. The package is distributed as a pure Python package, but also with pre-compiled wheels for major platforms, which include performance optimizations.

```console
$ pip install vibeml
```

The pre-compiled wheels are built using `mypyc` and will be used automatically if your platform is supported. You can check the files on PyPI to see the list of available wheels.

## Usage

Please see the [Command-line Reference] for details.

### Building Documentation Locally

```bash
# Install documentation dependencies
uv pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

# Serve documentation with live reload
mkdocs serve

# Build static site
mkdocs build
```

The documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development
